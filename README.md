# Day 9 - Tabbed Dashboard App 🔁

This is Day 9 of my 30-Day React Relearning Journey. The focus of this project is to:

- Build a multi-tabbed dashboard UI
- Use conditional rendering to display different tab content
- Split logic into modular components
- Introduce real-world features like settings toggles and activity lists

✅ How to structure components for reusability and clarity  
✅ How to handle toggle switches with `useState`  
✅ How to map over arrays to render dynamic content  
✅ How to build a mini dashboard layout with Tailwind CSS
